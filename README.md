According to Wikipedia: Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

This repo includes some examples that can be useful in understanding the concept of Monte Carlo Simulations.
